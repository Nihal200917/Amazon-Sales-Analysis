    "text": "Graph Explanation\nThe plot visualizes the predictions from a Bayesian regression model where total profit is modeled as a function of order year using a Gaussian distribution. The blue points represent the model’s predicted profits for each year from 2010 to 2026, while the red LOESS curve smooths these predictions to reveal the overall trend. The plot, with its clear axis labels, centered title, and styled caption, suggests how the model expects total profit to evolve over time, providing valuable insights into potential profit trends and helping guide future business decisions. The inclusion of a LOESS curve in the plot adds a nuanced layer of analysis by highlighting potential non-linear patterns that a simple linear regression might overlook. This is particularly important in financial forecasting, where trends can fluctuate due to various external factors. The Bayesian framework further strengthens the model by incorporating prior information and providing a probabilistic interpretation of the predictions, which can help in assessing uncertainty and making more informed decisions. Together, these elements make the plot a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding the complex dynamics of profit trends over time, offering both immediate insights and a foundation for deeper analysis."

    "text": "Explanation of regression table\nThe regression results provide an insight into the relationship between the predictor variables—Order Year and Sales Channel—and the predicted Total Profit. The estimated coefficient (Beta) for Order Year is 764, with a 95% Credible Interval (CI) ranging from -39,321 to 42,843. This wide interval, which includes zero, suggests that the effect of Order Year on Total Profit is uncertain, indicating no clear evidence of a positive or negative trend over time.\nFor the Sales Channel variable, the category Online has an estimated coefficient of -114,969 with a 95% CI of -294,935 to 58,348. This suggests that, on average, online sales may be associated with a decrease in Total Profit compared to the baseline (likely offline or another sales channel), but the large interval again includes zero, indicating considerable uncertainty."

    "text": "Sales profits from preferred sales channels have grown significantly. I gathered data from the Amazon Sales Kaggle dataset, covering 100 sales from 2010 to 2019. Using this information, we predicted future sales profits based on two main sales channels: Online and Offline. We modeled Total Profit, a numerical variable, as a linear function of Order Year. As the years progress, profits appear to increase. In conclusion, sales profits on both Sales Channel combined are predicted to rise by 764 (+/- 114969.12) units each year. However, this projection is subject to external factors that could influence Amazon’s profit margins."

The orange points represent individual predictions, while the maroon smooth line, created using a generalized additive model (GAM), illustrates the overall trend. The y-axis, ranging from -500,000 to 1,000,000, captures both potential losses and profits. The spread of points around the smooth line indicates variability in predictions, with the line suggesting whether profits are expected to rise, fall, or show a more complex pattern over time.
