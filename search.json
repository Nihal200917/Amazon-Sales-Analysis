    "text": "Graph Explanation\nThe plot visualizes the predictions from a Bayesian regression model where total profit is modeled as a function of order year using a Gaussian distribution. The blue points represent the model’s predicted profits for each year from 2010 to 2026, while the red LOESS curve smooths these predictions to reveal the overall trend. The plot, with its clear axis labels, centered title, and styled caption, suggests how the model expects total profit to evolve over time, providing valuable insights into potential profit trends and helping guide future business decisions. The inclusion of a LOESS curve in the plot adds a nuanced layer of analysis by highlighting potential non-linear patterns that a simple linear regression might overlook. This is particularly important in financial forecasting, where trends can fluctuate due to various external factors. The Bayesian framework further strengthens the model by incorporating prior information and providing a probabilistic interpretation of the predictions, which can help in assessing uncertainty and making more informed decisions. Together, these elements make the plot a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding the complex dynamics of profit trends over time, offering both immediate insights and a foundation for deeper analysis."

    "text": "Explanation of regression table\nThe output from your Bayesian regression model indicates that the predictor Order_Year has an estimated effect of increasing the outcome variable, likely total profit, by 971 units for each additional year. However, the 95% Credible Interval for this effect is wide, ranging from -40,693 to 43,245, suggesting significant uncertainty. This implies that the true effect of Order_Year could be either negative, positive, or close to zero."

I gathered information from Amazon Sales Kaggle dataset, covering 100 occurred sales throughout years from 2010 to 2019. we used this information to predict the result of sales profits in upcoming years depending on sales channels. We modeled Total Profit, a numerical variable, as a linear function of Order Years. As year increases Profit seams to increase. The Sales Profit in the Online Sales Channel is predicted to be increasing by $971 as each year advance, but this depends on external factors that might change the income profit for Amazon."
